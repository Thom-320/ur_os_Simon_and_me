# UR-OS Process Scheduling Simulator in Java

## Overview

The UR-OS simulator is a Java-based application designed to include all the main active components of a computer system in order to replicate the behavior of an operating system and its interaction with hardware elements such as the processor, memory, and file system.

This modular simulator allows users to select and combine different algorithms for each function. The current version, **0.0.3.8**, focuses on the **process scheduling** function. It currently implements the **First Come First Served (FCFS)** scheduling algorithm only. Performance indicators are not included in this version, as they were part of class projects.

This simulator was developed by **Pedro Wightman**, Associate Professor at the **School of Engineering, Science and Technology**, **Universidad del Rosario**, BogotÃ¡, Colombia.
